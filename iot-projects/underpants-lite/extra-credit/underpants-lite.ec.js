/** _.reduce
* Arguments:
*   1) An array
*   2) A function
*   3) A seed
* Objectives:
*   1) Call <function> for every element in <collection> passing the arguments:
*         previous result, element, index
*   2) Use the return value of <function> as the "previous result"
*      for the next iteration
*   3) On the very first iteration, use <seed> as the "previous result"
*   4) If no <seed> was given, use the first element/value of <collection> as <seed> and continue to the next element
*   5) After the last iteration, return the return value of the final <function> call
* Edge Cases:
*   1) What if <seed> is not given?
* Examples:
*   _.reduce([1,2,3], function(previousSum, currentValue, currentIndex){ return previousSum + currentValue }, 0) -> 6

/** _.extend
* Arguments:
*   1) An Object
*   2) An Object
*   ...Possibly more objects
* Objectives:
*   1) Copy properties from <object 2> to <object 1>
*   2) If more objects are passed in, copy their properties to <object 1> as well, in the order they are passed in.
*   3) Return the update <object 1>
* Examples:
*   var data = {a:"one"};
*   _.extend(data, {b:"two"}); -> data now equals {a:"one",b:"two"}
*   _.extend(data, {a:"two"}); -> data now equals {a:"two"}
